SurveyBox DNN Module Development

- Installation of the SurveyBox module into a DNN CMS webapplication is executed throught the default DNN wizard - menu Settings/Extensons/Install Extension - and by uploading the SurveyBox Installation package.

- SurveyBox Installation packages as of version 1.2 can be downloaded from this github site (releases). Previous versions are available at: http://spdnn.codeplex.com
